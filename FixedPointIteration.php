/**
 * Fixed Point Iteration
 *
 * In numerical analysis, the fixed point method is a method for finding
 * successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a continuous,
 * real-valued function f(x). For fixed point iteration, we require that we can
 * rewrite f(x) = 0 as g(x) = x for some continuous, real-valued function g(x).
 * We then determine some interval [a, b] to which we will iterate over. To
 * guarantee a root is in [a, b], we should chose [a, b] such that g(x) is
 * continuous and g(x) is in [a, b], for all x in [a, b]. To guarantee our
 * iteration will converge to a single root, we should choose [a, b] such that
 * for some 0 < k < 1, the magnitude of the derivative |g'(x)| < k on all x
 * in [a, b].
